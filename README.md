# Resumes
The Rails/Django code for my resume site

# Deployment caveats
Two images are not committed to the repo, but are required for proper functionality:
rails_resume/public/images/protected/GitHub-Mark-120px-plus.png
rails_resume/public/images/protected/In-White-121px-R.png
This is because those are company logos, and I am unsure of licensing issues on including them in my repo.
